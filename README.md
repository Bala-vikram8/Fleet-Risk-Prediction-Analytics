# 🚚 Fleet-Risk-Prediction-Analytics

## 📝 Project Overview : 
Running a big fleet is tough. Unplanned repairs and high-cost vehicles can throw off budgets fast. I wanted to help fleet managers see these risks before they become expensive surprises.
So, I built a full analytics solution that takes real maintenance and usage data, predicts future repair costs, and helps teams spot which vehicles need attention all in one easy dashboard.

## 🔍 What I Did

  •	Looked at data for more than 350,000 vehicles—including their repairs, age, and how much they’re used.

  •	Used machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict which units are likely to need costly repairs soon.
	
  •	Built a Tableau dashboard that makes it super simple to see cost drivers, high-risk vehicles, and overall trends.

## 🛠️ How I Did It

## Tools & Steps:
	
  •	**R:** For cleaning and preparing the data, creating new features (like “jobs per year” or “risk flag”), and building predictive models.
	
  •	**Tableau:** To bring the numbers and trends to life in a dashboard that anyone on the team can use.
	
  •	Cleaned and merged info from assets, work orders, and usage logs.
	
  •	Explored the data to find patterns—like which assets cost the most, or what age is riskiest.
	
  •	Trained machine learning models to make predictions, and checked their accuracy.
	
  •	Pulled it all together into a dashboard that highlights what matters.

 
  ## 🏆 What I Achieved
	
  •	**Predicted costly repairs before they happened,** giving managers a heads-up on where to focus.
	
  •	**Spotted the top 10% highest-risk vehicles** so maintenance teams could act before small problems became expensive ones.
	
  •	**Mapped out where the most money was being spent** by asset, repair type, or location helping leaders budget smarter.
	
  •	**Enabled real-time, data-driven decisions** through an interactive dashboard anyone can use.
	
  •	**Improved visibility for the whole team:** Now, executives and on the-ground staff can all see the same risk and cost insights.

  ## 💡 Recommendations
  
  •	**Watch the top 10% riskiest vehicles closely** that’s where you can prevent the biggest losses.
	
  •	**Update your maintenance plan** using these cost and risk predictions—not just past history.
	
  •	**Use the dashboard filters** to dig into asset types or locations where costs spike, and take targeted action.

## 🧑‍🎓 What I Gained
	
  •	Real-world experience with **end-to-end data projects**: cleaning, feature engineering, building ML models, and dashboard design.
	
  •	Learned how to turn rows of numbers into clear business stories for decision-makers.
	
  •	Grew my skills in building analytics tools that actually get used to solve operational problems.
